# Best Guacamole Ever

**Contents**
>* Avocados (number varies depending on how many people you're serving, everything else is to taste in proportion to the these)
>* Lime
>* Salt (I like fine sea salt. Also add some Murray River salt for variety)
>* Red Onion
>* Garlic (just a bit. can become overbearing quickly. seriously, use sparingly)
>* Serrano Peppers (start with one, add enough to get a good kick)
>* Tomatoes
>* Honey (the smallest amount should do the trick. talking a few drops here)

**A word about cilantro:** 
In consideration of those 10% of people who find cilantro to taste weird and soapy (myself included), this recipe excludes the strange herb.
