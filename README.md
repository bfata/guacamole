# Best Guacamole Ever

**Contents**
>* Avocados (number varies depending on how many people you're serving, everything else is to taste in proportion to the these)
>* Lime
>* Salt (I like fine sea salt)
>* Red Onion
>* Cilantro (an excessive amount)
>* Serrano Peppers (start with one, add enough to get a good kick)
>* Tomatoes (these go in last)

**A word about garlic:** 
I've had people ask me why I don't use garlic in my recipe. Frankly, there's a great deal of amazing flavor with the above ingredients alone. I don't think it's needed. That said, if you fork this recipe and do some fancy shit please make a pull request.
